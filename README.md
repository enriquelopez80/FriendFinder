# FriendFinder

## Description

Friend Finder matches the user with a friend based on the user's response to a survey. The user responds to questions using a 5 point scale. When submitted, the user's responses are compared to an exsisting friend in the database and that match is displayed. The friend that is matched is the person with the lowest difference of the combined questions.

The app is run using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) along with [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser), and [path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path) NPM packages.
